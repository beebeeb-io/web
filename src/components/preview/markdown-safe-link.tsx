/**
 * Shared `react-markdown` `a` component override (task 1563 PR #103 review
 * thread) — opens links in a NEW TAB with `noopener noreferrer`, same as the
 * read-mode markdown renderer already did. Used by both markdown-preview.tsx
 * (read mode) and the editor's split-view live preview (file-editor.tsx),
 * so a link click can never navigate the CURRENT tab away — which is what
 * let a click bypass the editor's unsaved-changes guard: the draft only
 * lives in memory, and a same-tab navigation unmounts the editor with no
 * guard in the loop at all (there's nothing to intercept — the browser is
 * leaving the page, not React).
