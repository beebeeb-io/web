/**
 * Task 1565 (web #107) added a 300ms debounce to the non-previewable
 * single-click → `onSelectFile` side effect in file-list.tsx's row click
 * handler, to stop a synchronous select from mounting FileDetailsPanel's
 * full-viewport click-to-close backdrop in the gap between a double-click's
 * two native 'click' events (see file-list.tsx's own comment on
 * `pendingSelectTimerRef` for the full story of that bug).
 *
 * That fix only cleared the timer from the SAME row's own `onDoubleClick`
 * handler. Every OTHER control-flow path that can follow a non-previewable
 * single click within the 300ms window left the stale timer armed:
 *
 *   - a plain single click on a folder (navigates immediately, never
 *     touched the timer)
 *   - a plain single click on a previewable file (opens the preview
 *     immediately, never touched the timer)
 *   - a shift-click range-select or a Cmd/Ctrl-click toggle-select
 *   - keyboard activation (Enter) of a different row
 *
 * In every one of those cases the stale timer still fired ~300ms after the
 * ORIGINAL click and called `onSelectFile` for that first, now-irrelevant
 * file — popping its details panel open over whatever the user had since
 * navigated to or opened. A double-click's own `onDoubleClick` already
 * clears unconditionally (so double-clicking the SAME row, or double-
 * clicking a DIFFERENT row fast enough for the native 'dblclick' to land
 * before 300ms elapses, was already safe) — the gap was specifically the
 * single-click and keyboard branches above.
 *
 * Fix: every entry point that represents "the user is now doing something
 * else with this list" clears the pending timer FIRST, unconditionally,
 * before deciding what that something else is. Only the one case that
 * legitimately wants a timer — a single click on a non-previewable file —
 * arms a new one.
 *
 * This module is deliberately framework-free (no React, no DOM) so it can be
 * unit-tested directly: this repo's `bun test` harness has no
 * @testing-library/react / jsdom (see
 * test/1518-billing-reset-shared-handler.test.ts's header comment).
 * file-list.tsx wires a `useRef<PendingSelectTimerRef['current']>(null)`
 * into a `PendingSelectTimerRef` object and calls these functions from its
 * row click / dblclick / keydown handlers and its unmount effect.
