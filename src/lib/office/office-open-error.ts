/**
 * Office open errors (task 1585, item 2).
 *
 * `bbOffice.open()` runs inside the engine iframe, so its rejections are
 * `Error`s from THAT realm: `err instanceof Error` is false in the host page
 * (each realm has its own `Error` constructor). office-editor.tsx used to test
 * exactly that, so every engine failure — a damaged file, an engine that never
 * booted — reached the user as the same generic "Failed to open this
 * document".
 *
 * This module is the boundary: it reads the rejection by shape (a `message`
 * string, and an optional `kind` the bridge may attach in a later engine
 * build), turns it into a host-realm `OfficeOpenError` with a real `kind`, and
 * pairs each kind with an honest, specific message. The raw engine text rides
 * along as `detail` (shown in mono under the message) — it is what a support
 * request needs, never what a user should have to parse.
 *
 * The kinds are grounded in what repos/office/bridge actually rejects with
 * (bb-office-api.js / bb-office-worker.js at office 743e7cc):
 *   - `bb-office-api.js: Module.uno_main never appeared within …ms`
 *       → the engine did not finish loading          → 'engine-not-loaded'
 *   - `loadComponentFromURL returned null for <name> (filter …)`, or a UNO
 *     IO/IllegalArgument exception thrown by the load itself
 *       → LibreOffice could not read the bytes        → 'invalid-document'
 *   - anything else from the engine                  → 'engine-failed'
 * `decrypt-failed` is raised by the office route itself (office-editor-page),
 * before the engine ever sees the bytes.
